# Single Page Basic Website for Salon Business

## Written entirely in Rust with Web Assembly

`/styles/input.css` contains Tailwind layer classes

Use `trunk serve` to start up development server

Use `npx tailwindcss -i ./styles/input.css -o ./styles/output.css --watch` to start up automatic recompilation of Tailwind classes.

## Deployment Process

Deployment is easy as the Rust crate Trunk allows us to use a build target of Web Assembly, which runs natively in browser when sprinkled with some autogenerated JavaScript. The Single Page Application, itself, is running web assembly.

In order to take a repo, and turn it into a publically accessible site, simply give any static cloud hosting service (Vercel, Netlify) the GitHub repository, then utilize the "trunk build" command to generate a `/dist/` folder, which will be located in `./dist/`. Then, you need _no build commands_ at all, on the hosting site. Simply tell them the root folder is "dist/" (Vercel bawked at me for using "/dist/", so presume they want the extension to add to "./")

_Всё!_ (Done!) Your page is accessible online.
